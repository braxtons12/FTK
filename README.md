# Fusion
Fusion DAW

An in-progress Digital Audio Workstation still very much in its infancy.
Currently consists of

Fusion-Core:
  The core for I/O and graphics/UI.
  
  Graphics is built from scratch on top of OpenGL and uses a throttled(60fps) high-performance rendering engine
  to maintain performance while minimizing cpu overhead.
  
  This is still very much in its infancy and is only just starting to get recognizable UI features
  
Anything else:
  Nothing yet. :(
